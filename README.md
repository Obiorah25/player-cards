1. Player Data (players.js)
The players.js file contains an array of JSON objects, each representing a player. The attributes for each player include:

name: The player's name
team: The team the player belongs to
nationality: The player's nationality
jerseyNumber: The player's jersey number
age: The player's age
imageUrl: A URL to the player's image
2. Player Component (Player.js)
The Player.js file defines a Player component that renders a react-bootstrap card. The card displays all the attributes of the player. The component uses destructuring to access these attributes and applies some inline styling. Default props are defined for each attribute.

3. Players List Component (PlayersList.js)
The PlayersList.js file contains a PlayersList component that imports and maps through the players' data from players.js. It renders a Player component for each player in the list, passing the player attributes as props to the Player component.

4. Root Component (App.js)
The App.js file imports the PlayersList component and renders it within the main application.
